-- Start mongo DB (run mongo.exe)
-- run command: 'show dbs' (this will show all dbs available)
-- run command: 'use ihs' (this will create db ihs and now we are pointing to this DB)
-- run commands below to insert collection Campaign and User and documents. Copy paste 1 command and press enter untill all are executed. I was unable to work with whole file. Will re-look.

-- Once commands are run:
-- To check collections , run command: 'show collections'
-- To check for documents in Campaign: 'db.Campaign.find()'
-- To check for documents in User: 'db.User.find()'
-- To check index on collection Campaign: 'db.Campaign.getIndexes()'
-- To drop collection Campaign: 'db.Campaign.drop()'
-- We might need to create PK and index as when inserting collection, getting text autoIndexId will be removed in future releases
